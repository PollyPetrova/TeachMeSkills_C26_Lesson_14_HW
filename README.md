Let's say there is a file with document numbers.
The document number is a string consisting of letters and numbers (without service characters).
Let this file contain each document number from a new line and no
other information in the line, only the document number.
A valid document number must be 15 characters long and begin with the sequence
docnum (hereinafter any sequence of letters/numbers) or contract (hereinafter any sequence of letters/numbers).
Write a program to read information from an input file - the path to the input
file must be set via the console.
The program should check the document numbers for validity.
Valid docnum document numbers should be recorded in a single report file.
Valid contract numbers should be recorded in another report file.
Oshikbi, if they occur, should be written to a file error_log.txt
Logs should be written to a file execution_log.txt
Invalid document numbers should be written to another report file, but after
the document numbers, you should add information about why this document
is invalid (incorrect sequence of characters at the beginning /there are service characters in the document name and more).
